# ♻️ ZeroWasteX — AI-Powered Smart Waste Segregation System

ZeroWasteX is a futuristic waste management system designed to **automate waste segregation** using **Computer Vision (CV)** and **AI-based usefulness scoring**. By combining intelligent object detection, layered screening, and value-based redirection, it turns trash into **impactful end-products** — all while aligning with the **United Nations SDG goals**.

## 🚀 How It Works

> A sample load of waste enters the machine. As it moves through a conveyor system, the process unfolds:

1. **🎥 Visual Analysis (Computer Vision)**  
   A trained CV model identifies each waste item using real-time video feed.

2. **🧠 Material Classification**  
   Items are classified into categories like plastic, metal, organic, glass, etc.

3. **📊 Usefulness Scoring**  
   Each item is assigned a "usefulness percentage" based on repurposing potential (e.g., plastic → bricks, organic → enzymes).

4. **🔁 Layered Sorting Mechanism**  
   A multi-level conveyor physically sorts items based on type and score.

5. **✨ Final Output**  
   Waste is transformed into **eco-friendly, usable sub-products**, reducing landfill and carbon impact.
