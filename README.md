# ♻️ ZeroWasteX — AI-Powered Smart Waste Segregation System

ZeroWasteX is a futuristic waste management system designed to **automate waste segregation** using **Computer Vision (CV)** and **AI-based usefulness scoring**. By combining intelligent object detection, layered screening, and value-based redirection, it turns trash into **impactful end-products** — all while aligning with the **United Nations SDG goals**.

## 🚀 How It Works

> A sample load of waste enters the machine. As it moves through a conveyor system, the process unfolds:

1. **🎥 Visual Analysis (Computer Vision)**  
   A trained CV model identifies each waste item using real-time video feed.

2. **🧠 Material Classification**  
   Items are classified into categories like plastic, metal, organic, glass, etc.

3. **📊 Usefulness Scoring**  
   Each item is assigned a "usefulness percentage" based on repurposing potential (e.g., plastic → bricks, organic → enzymes).

4. **🔁 Layered Sorting Mechanism**  
   A multi-level conveyor physically sorts items based on type and score.

5. **✨ Final Output**  
   Waste is transformed into **eco-friendly, usable sub-products**, reducing landfill and carbon impact.

## 📊 Smart Dashboard

1. Experience the full functionality of our project through the Smart Dashboard — a dynamic interface that offers an interactive demo for users to explore key features in real time.

2. The Smart Dashboard comes equipped with a live demo, allowing users to simulate operations and gain hands-on insight into how the system responds to various inputs and conditions.

3. This intelligent dashboard is not just for show — it includes a working demo that showcases our project's core modules in action, making it easy for anyone to test and understand the workflow.

4. Dive into the demo mode to visualize data pipelines, real-time updates, and alert mechanisms — all integrated into a sleek, user-friendly dashboard interface.

5. Curious about how it all works? Launch the built-in demo from the Smart Dashboard and watch the system come alive with interactive visuals and simulations.
