# Dataset Explanation

## Overview

The main objective is to enable machine learning models to automatically classify images, potentially related to waste detection, sorting, or environmental monitoring.

## Dataset Structure

- The dataset is organized in a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yaDgsM6wbVo9189S_lTEfDG0WESpDpPC?usp=sharing).
- Images are grouped into subfolders (Bio-Degradable and Non-Bio-Degradable, each representing a different class/category.
- Folder names correspond to class labels (e.g., `plastic`, `metal`, `glass`, etc.).
- Each subfolder contains images belonging to that class.

## Intended Usage

- **Benchmarking**: Compare and benchmark different classification algorithms for waste classsification and environmental image data.
